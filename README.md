Project Title: Baseline α-synuclein seeding activity and Parkinson’s disease progression in the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative cohort

Project Overview: Included in this repository is the R code used to create figures and analyze longitudinal and a-synuclein seeding amplification assay data from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI). The data used here can be found in the PPMI Database (www.ppmi-info.org/access-data-specimens/download-data; RRID:SCR00_6431).
